        <h2>What are your thoughts on Pre Work Week 1?</h2>
        <br>
          <p>
            Week 1 of 20 is in the books! I must say that Pre Work Week 1 had it's
            challenges. At times I was very frustrated at my lack of knowledge. As I
            was confronted with challenges and blockers, I looked to the information
            provided in the Trello board, as well as reaching out via the Slack Help
            channel. What a blessing that has been to my classmates and I.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h2>
            My Biggest Challenge
          </h2>
          <br>
          <p>
            My biggest challenge was working through the command line. I wanted to
            start off week 1 strong and I knew focusing on command line would be
            priority #1 for me. As the week came to a close, I began to feel more
            confident in command line, but not confident enough to know I am not at a
            place where I can begin to feel comfortable. There is a lot of work to be
            done and I am excited to work!
          </p>

          <h2>
            What did I learn this week?
          </h2>
          <br>
          <p>
            This week I learned how to create a local repository with files by way of
            the command line. It is so simple to right click on the desktop and create
            a folder, but I really enjoyed learning how to do it through the command
            line. I learned that the Command Line is bittersweet to a beginner. You
            can begin to see the beauty of what you can accomplish once you get past
            the blockers.

            I also learned how to merge an existing project to a Github repository,
            and the importance of having a local and remote copy of your work.
