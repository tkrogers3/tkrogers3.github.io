  <h2>What are your thoughts on pseudo coding?</h2>
<br>
<p>I have come to realize that if you don't come into a project with a plan, if you try to piece things together as they go, you can get <em><b>lost</b></em> in a mess of code. 
One thing I enjoy about pseudo coding is that you have a game plan. You have an understanding of where you're trying to go. From there, you map out your destination. I am an <i>"on the fly"</i> guy, so I am going to have to wrangle myself in to being diciplined to keep to the pseudo code model. It saves headaches and time.</p>
<br>
<h2>What are you struggling with?</h2>
<br>
<p> I have been struggling with several things this week.<br>
<ol>
  <br>
  <li> I have struggled with files and folder in my blog. I created a folder inside of my blog folder to hold each of my weekly blog posts. 
      I have not figured out why my directories are not lining up correctly. When I click the nav bar to take me home or to a weekly blog link, I get an error. This is very frustraiting because I am waisting a lot of time on an issue that should be easily resolvable for an experienced programmer, but it is a mountain for this "young in the tooth" novice. </li>


  <li> I am working through CSS and I find it fasinating how much it can revoltuionize a webpage. I watched several videos and demos of CSS this week, trying to learn skills to impliment into my code. I want to be further aliong than I am, so my mistake is trying to overwhelm myself with tasks I am not ready to take on. The importance of these first few weeeks of learning to to know enough information to get to the next week. Theres no way to be in an advanced state this early in the journey, so my goal is to soak in the basics and learn as I go, knowing mistakes will be made and it's ok to be ok. The knowledge will come in time. </li>
</ol></p>
<br>
<h2>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</h2>
<br>
<p>I am excited to learn more about CSS this week. With Java Script coming up as well, I want to get a firm grasp of the basics of CSS. I have some experience in Java Script from a prior course, and I remember how challenging it is. I want to be on my toe going into the next weeks lessons and assignments to present a nice product from Pre Work Week 3 Demo Day.</p>
