    <h2>What are your thoughts about the roles that HTML,
      CSS and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?</h2>
    <br>
    <p> When I was first introduced to the concept of a website built by HTML, CSS and Javascript, I was introduced to
      it as
      a 3 layer cake. Each layer providing crucial substance to a webpage. Sure, a vanilla (HTML) cake tastes fine as
      is,
      but add a layer of chocolate (CSS) and it enhances your taste buds. However if you really want a full delicious
      experience, you can top is off with a layer strawberry and you get the full taste experience. I think thats how
      I'm learning a web page works.Sure HTML and HTML and CSS webpages can look great, but user experience
      ignites when JavaScript comes to play. Without it, our online shopping experiences wouldn't be the same,
      we'd have no Netflix to binge, and we wouldn't know when we've met our allotted characters when typing a tweet.

    <p> This week I've really been relying on JavaScript notation, videos on JavaScript and better ways to understand
      its functionality.I've been working hard on trying to understand what is being asked of be,
      pseudo coding how to approach the problem,and then looking for the tools I need to complete the problem.
      This has been a struggle to me because I like to jump head first into a problem with basic information,
      when sometimes I need to take a step back and gather all of the puzzle pieces and come up with a plan of action.

    <h2>What are some objects that your blog incorporates?</h2>

    <p> I am sad that I haven't added any JavaScript to my blog at this point. I want to be diligent
      in running my own code when I add JS to my page, and at this point I haven't. I am hoping that
      Pre Work Week 4 will help me gain confidence and understanding in creating my own JS for my blog.
      I would like to add a comment section to my blog for others to leave advice or comments on my work thus far.
