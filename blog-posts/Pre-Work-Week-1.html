    <h2><b> Week 1 Thoughts</b></h2>
    <p>
      Week 1 of 20 is in the books! I must say that Prework Week 1 had it's
      challenges. At times I was very frustrated at my lack of knowledge. As I
      was confronted with challenges and blockers, I looked to the information
      provided in the Trello board, as well as reaching out via the Slack Help
      channel. What a blessing that has been to my classmates and I.
    </p>

    <h3>
      My Biggest Challenge
    </h3>
    <p>
      My biggest challenge was working through the command line. I wanted to
      start off week 1 strong and I knew focusing on command line would be
      priority #1 for me. As the week came to a close, I began to feel more
      confident in command line, but not confident enough to know I am not at a
      place where I can begin to feel comfortable. There is a lot of work to be
      done and I am excited to work!

    <h3>
      What did I learn this week?
    </h3>
    <p>
      This week I learned how to create a local repository with files by way of
      the command line. It is so simple to right click on the desktop and create
      a folder, but I really enjoyed learning how to do it through the command
      line. I learned that the Command Line is bittersweet to a beginner. You
      can begin to see the beauty of what you can accomplish once you get past
      the blockers.

      I also learned how to merge an existing project to a Github repository,
      and the importance of having a local and remote copy of your work.
