    <h1>Week One</h1>
    <br />
    <h2>
      What did you learn about that helped you understand more about design?
    </h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      I learned more about the importance of contrast, repetition,
      alignment and proximity, and how all of them work together to make a quality
      product. Upon looking at examples of low quality work, it opened my eyes to seeing how easy it can
      be to make mistakes, and how to develop an eye for things that make the product less desirable.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h2>What do you want to continue learning about that helps you understand design better? </h2>

    <p> Well personally I want to learn to design better on Bootstrap. I had fun with the template
      in my project this week, but I want to understand it enough that I can piece my blog together without
      having to use a template. I struggled with that this weekend as I tried to create my new Blog homepage. </p>


    <br />

    <h2>
      What Design aspects are important to you as a user and as a developer?
    </h2>
    <br />

    <p>
      As a user, I want a product that doesn't make me do the work. I like to see a clean, readable
      product that doesn't require my eyes to do the work of the developer. I want to be able to find
      what I'm looking for in a website or app without scouring the site. As a developer, I want to
      provide that to my clients.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h2>
      What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?
    </h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      I think my lack of understanding on Bootstrap the first day we worked on it held me up a day.
      I had an idea of what I wanted to do, but my ideas were not matching up with the way I was comprehending the
      documentation. I was confused by the grid system. The columns, rows, sizes ect. I am pretty happy
      with the Campaign project I made. I would like to add some things to my blog that didn't make the Campaign
      project.

      <br />

    <h2>
      What is one thing you would like to get better at in bootcamp?

    </h2>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      Time management. Assessing the tasks at hand, setting a time period that I work on each item,
      and moving on to the next task. There are components that I struggled with this week and I took
      way to long to decide to keep them or move on. The Bootstrap carousel being one. I wasted way too much
      time trying to get that thing working.</p>
