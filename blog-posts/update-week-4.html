    <h1>Pre Work Week 4</h1>
    <br />
    <h2>
      What was one thing you liked and disliked about each of the new topics
      covered in prework?
    </h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      Week 1 of HTML was very enjoyable. HTML seemed to be pretty easy to
      learn and it was a great start to to get me ready for the Boot Camp
      journey. I really can't think of anything that I disliked about HTML.
    </p>

    <br />
    <p>
      Week 2 starting the journey in HTML and CSS was a challenge but also
      rewarding. I appreciated learning how to style elements to bring an HTML
      page to life. I am still learning my way around CSS so one thing I
      wasn't crazy about was how many details can go into one element and how
      hard it is to memorize all of the styles and weights to an style. I've
      got a ways to go in making a webpage from scratch beautiful but I am
      still very early in my journey.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      Weeks 3 and 4 of JavaScript were the hardest of Bootcamp so far for me
      as I got lost in all of the syntax. Functions, operators, loops, if/else
      statements, arrays, methods, variables, strings, booleans... you name
      it, I got confused about it! There was so much information that I tried
      to contain it all and I could only fit some much into my current 8gb
      mind! I'm looking forward to growing with JS and having it become a
      close friend. I feel as though I've come a good way in the last 2 weeks,
      but as I go into week 5, and week 1 of in house Bootcamp, I will have
      times that I am still confused and challenged, but I am also excited to
      learn from my instructors, with my classmates. I truly believe we will
      all bring out the best in each other!
    </p>

    <br />
    <h2>
      What was helpful?
    </h2>
    <br />

    <p>
      So many things helped me along during the 4 weeks I learned from home.
      These are the 3 that most come to mind.

      <br />
      <br />
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Slack</li>
      <br />
      <ul>
        I can't begin to say how useful it was to have the Help Channel on
        Slack. It became a place of refuge for my classmates and I was we
        dealt with challenges, blockers and frustration. Every time someone
        asked a question, we all jumped in to see 1. if there was something we
        could learn as well, and 2. If there was something we already knew
        that we could helped each other with.
      </ul>
      <br />
      <li>Google Hangouts</li>
      <br />
      <ul>
        Being at a place where you're blocked can be very discouraging. You've
        put hours into a project and you just can't get the code to work.
        That's where the beauty of Google Hangouts came in. Having Justin and
        Ian walk through our code with us and point us in the right direct was
        invaluable. Their patience and understanding towards us brought a lot
        of encouragement and ease to us knowing that they want us to succeed
        and cheer us in out victories and build us up in our failures.
      </ul>
      <br />
      <li>Pseudo Code</li>
      <br />
      <ul>
        In coding, you've got to have a plan before you dive into a project.
        Pseudo coding has been and will continue to to be the foundation for
        any project I take on the rest of my career. It is nice to be able to
        comment out your pseudo code and work through the code with the
        comments as a guide.
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <br />
    <h2>
      What hindered your progress?
    </h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      I believe my progress was hindered several ways. Life gets in the way at
      times. I found that when I would sit time aside to work on a specific
      task, as soon as I would sit down to begin working, something would
      happen that would require my attention.
      <br />
      <br />
      I also think that the wealth of material that has been made available to
      us was part of my hindrance. I found that my lack of unfamiliarity to
      certain projects was a lot at times. I would scour to find any
      information that would assist my cause, and at times it slowed me down.
      When I invest in something, I like doing research to make sure it is
      worthwhile. I has found out these last 4 weeks that it takes time to
      develop knowledge to do certain tasks, or learn ways to be DRY in my and
      make things simpler. I must take with me from this last month that it's
      ok to not be ok, and that in time things will become easier as my
      knowledge grows.
      <br />
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />

    <h2>
      How did you overcome challenges?
    </h2>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      Like I mentioned earlier, the things that were helpful helped me
      overcome my challenges. Guidance from classmates and instructors, pseudo
      code, reading, watching code demonstrations, walking away and breathing,
      getting a good nights rest to tackle the problem the next day. All of
      these things helped me this month. Also, coffee. Lots of coffee.
