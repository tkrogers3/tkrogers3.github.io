  <h1>Prework Week 2</h1>

<h2>What are your thoughts on pseudo coding?</h2>
<br>
<p>I have come to realize that if you don't come into a project with a plan, if you try to piece things together as they go, you can get <em><b>lost</b></em> in a mess of code. 
One thing I enjoy about pseudo coding is that you have a game plan. You have an understanding of where you're trying to go. From there, you map out your destination. I am an <i>"on the fly"</i> guy, so I am going to have to wrangle myself in to be diciplined to keeping to the pseudo code model. It saves headaches and time.</p>
<br>
<h2>What are you struggling with?</h2>
<br>
<p> I have been struggling with several things this week.<br>
<ol>
  <br>
  <li> I have struggled with files and folder in my blog. I created a folder inside of my blog folver to hold each of my weekly blog posts. 
      I have not figured out why my directories are not lining up correctly. When I click the nav bar to take me home or to a weekly blog link, I get an error. This is very frustraiting because I am waisting a lot of time on an issue that should be easily resolvable for an experienced programmer, but it is a mountian for this young in the tooth novice. </li>


  <li> I am working through CSS and I find it fasinating how much it can revoltuionize a webpage. I watched several videos and demos of CSS this week, trying to learn skills to impliment into my code. I want to be further aliong than I am, so my mistake is trying to overwhelm myself with tasks I am not ready to take on. The importance of these first few weeeks of learning to to know enough information to get to the next week. Theres no way to be in an advanced state this early in the journey, so my goal is to soak in the basics and learn as I go, knowing mistakes will be made and it's ok to be ok. The knowledge will come in time. </li>
</ol></p>
<br>
<h2>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</h2>
<br>
<p>I am excited to learn more about CSS this week. With Java Script coming up as well, I want to get a firm grasp of the basics of CSS. I have some experience in Java Script from a prior course, and I remember how challenging it is. I want to be on my toe going into the next weeks lessons and assignments to present a nice product from Pre Work Week 3 Demo Day.</p>

<br>
<h2>What are your thoughts on Pre Work Week 1?</h2>
<br>
  <p>
    Week 1 of 20 is in the books! I must say that Prework Week 1 had it's
    challenges. At times I was very frustrated at my lack of knowledge. As I
    was confronted with challenges and blockers, I looked to the information
    provided in the Trello board, as well as reaching out via the Slack Help
    channel. What a blessing that has been to my classmates and I.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>
    My Biggest Challenge
  </h2>
  <br>
  <p>
    My biggest challenge was working through the command line. I wanted to
    start off week 1 strong and I knew focusing on command line would be
    priority #1 for me. As the week came to a close, I began to feel more
    confident in command line, but not confident enough to know I am not at a
    place where I can begin to feel comfortable. There is a lot of work to be
    done and I am excited to work!
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>
    What did I learn this week?
  </h2>
  <br>
  <p>
    This week I learned how to create a local repository with files by way of
    the command line. It is so simple to right click on the desktop and create
    a folder, but I really enjoyed learning how to do it through the command
    line. I learned that the Command Line is bittersweet to a beginner. You
    can begin to see the beauty of what you can accomplish once you get past
    the blockers.

    <br />
    <br />

    I also learned how to merge an existing project to a Github repository,
    and the importance of having a local and remote copy of your work.
